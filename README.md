# Supratip Bhattacharya

Senior Full-Stack Engineer (frontend-leaning) — I build clean UIs, practical backends, and ship AI features that actually help users.  
I like small, reviewable changes, fast pages, and boringly reliable systems.

## Experience
**Kimberly-Clark — Senior Full-Stack / AI Engineer**  
- Frontend: React/Next.js + TypeScript, component design, performance profiling, a11y.  
- Backend: Node/Express & Python (FastAPI), REST/GraphQL, Postgres/Redis, queues.  
- AI: RAG/agents in production, prompt & response tracing, eval hooks, guardrails.  
- Ops: Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), basic monitoring/alerts.

## Side Project
**Prominence** — “SEO for LLM search” (side project)  
- Featured in the **bolt.new worldwide hackathon**; **1,000+ signups**.  
- Stack: React + Tailwind + Framer (FE), Node/Express + Puppeteer/Cheerio (BE), LLM providers.  
- Live: https://prominence.live

## How I work
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.  
- Write tests around behavior that matters.  
- Measure before optimizing; document the why.

## Off the clock
- Cooking (I plate better than my CSS grids, most days).  
- Cricket (middle-order optimist, death-over realist).
